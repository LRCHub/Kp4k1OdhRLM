Bull or matador - do I wield horns or sword?
Intoxicated with this blood I know not where from

A suit of lights for the moment supreme
Let it stain-terrify
To resound in their dreams

Throw out the cape
Bisected by history
Sword point at the nape
Let me come back to me

A suit of lights for the moment supreme
Let it stain-terrify
To resound in their dreams

Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, I'll be there

Enwrapped in glowing skin a face he could not hide
Feast on their exposed ribs
Would not fall 'fore he died

A suit of lights for the moment supreme
Let it stain-terrify
To resound in their dreams
