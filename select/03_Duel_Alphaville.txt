This is a walk into the dark
Master of duel, lighting a cigarette
Flash in the rain, sign of a walk into the dark
You'll make it for sure.

Here she comes, closer than ever
Out in the cold neon night, lost in the road, lonely girl
Now she stops somehow alarmed
Closer than ever
Breaking your heart once again

Rendezvoyeur, what will you do?
Maybe you let her go, maybe you don't
You just can't decide to show up or hide
She'll never know. just let go! oh no!

What you gonna do, boy
You waited too long, now you have to go on
She'll never know, just let go!
Rendezvoyeur, what will you do?
May be you let her go, just go!

You waited too long but whatever you do
It seems to me she waits here for you too.
